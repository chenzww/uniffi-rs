# Regression tests for uniffi components

This directory contains standalone uniffi component crates designed
as regression tests for specific historical bugs. They're written
for automated execution and *not* for being easily understandable
by users; if you're trying to get your head around uniff then the
"examples" directory will be a much better bet.
